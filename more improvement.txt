1) Add context & interpretation

What: Explain each port/service in one short line.
Why: Helps students understand what a port does.
Example:

Port 135 → RPC (Remote Procedure Call)

2) Show risk level

What: Add a Risk column with Low / Medium / High.
Why: Quick assessment of danger per port/service.
Notes: Can be driven from a configurable static list (e.g., known Windows attack surfaces).

3) Indicate connection direction

What: Add Direction column: Inbound / Outbound / Listening.
Why: Shows server vs client behavior at a glance.

4) Highlight unusual connections

What: Flag connections to foreign or unknown IPs.
Rule (example): mark if remote_ip is outside private ranges: 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16–31.x.x.
Why: Quickly draws attention to potentially suspicious external traffic.

5) Capture timestamps

What: Add a Timestamp column (ISO 8601).
Why: Lets you track when ports open/close and correlate events.

6) Detect interface & network profile

What: Show adapter name + profile (Public/Private/Host-only).
Example display:

Local IP: 192.168.100.68 (Wi-Fi, Private)

Local IP: 192.168.56.1 (VirtualBox, Host-Only)

7) Educational mode (--explain)

What: A switch that outputs human-readable context & short remediation.
Example output:

Port 445 (SMB) is open and listening. This is used for Windows file sharing and can be exploited if exposed externally.

Suggested minimal table (columns to show)

Timestamp | Direction | Local (IP:Port) | Remote (IP:Port) | Protocol | Interface (Profile) | Service | Risk | Flags | Notes

If you want, I can quickly convert this into a single-line checklist, a small UI mockup, or a JSON schema for the table — which would you prefer?
